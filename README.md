# Netflix-Movies-Analysis

### Project Summary
This project is part of a learning exercise at Vephla University, aimed at developing hands-on skills in data analysis and dashboard creation using real-world datasets. The focus is on analyzing Netflix’s movie catalog through a data-driven lens, using Microsoft Excel for data visualization and insight generation. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was processed and explored to uncover patterns in content performance, viewer preferences, and revenue trends.

### Tools and Dataset
All analysis and visualization work was carried out using Microsoft Excel, leveraging pivot tables, slicers, charts, and formatting tools. The dataset originates from Kaggle, containing rich metadata on Netflix movies including attributes like language, director, genre, country, release year, ratings, and revenue.

### Key Insights and Observations
The analysis highlights 2017 as the most profitable year, recording the highest revenue across the entire period. This spike in performance points to possible successful strategies or standout content released during that year.
Tyler Perry emerges as the most prolific director with 132 titles—substantially more than the other top directors, each of whom contributed between 15 and 20 films. His dominance signals a strong creative presence within the platform's catalog.
In terms of language, English (EN) overwhelmingly leads with 9533 movies, followed distantly by French (1054), Japanese (904), Korean (876), and Spanish (731). This reveals a heavy tilt toward English content, but also indicates room for growth in non-English markets.
“Eden” is the highest-rated movie with a score of 30.633, followed by Prey, The Killer, Monster, and others. A detailed look into what makes these titles successful could provide key insights for future content development.
Drama is the most prevalent and favored genre, with significant representation also in Comedy, Documentary, Horror, and hybrid categories like Drama-Romance. While Drama leads in volume and popularity, the frequency of “Action, Adventure” in the genre filters suggests it's a category worth tracking more closely.
Geographic data reveals that the United States holds the largest share in content popularity, with 5421 entries—far ahead of countries like Japan, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom. This confirms the U.S. as Netflix’s core market.
The yearly revenue trend shows key peaks in 2017–2018 and again in 2023, suggesting successful strategies or influential content in those years. The dashboard also indicates continuous content production from 2010 to 2023, reflecting a consistent release strategy.

### Recommendations
To build on these findings, further investigation into what drove the 2017 revenue spike—be it individual movies, campaigns, or broader trends—could help replicate success in future years.
Given Tyler Perry’s outsized contribution, analyzing audience engagement with his movies could yield valuable insights. His success could inform strategic collaborations or inspire similar production models.
Though English dominates, there’s value in studying the performance of French, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish content to guide international expansion and localization strategies.
The high rating of “Eden” suggests it holds lessons for content success—genre, cast, and themes should be analyzed to identify replicable elements.
Given the strong performance of Drama and Comedy, continued investment in these genres is advisable. However, Documentary, Horror, and especially Action-Adventure—which appears frequently in filters—should be monitored for performance trends.
With the U.S. leading in content popularity, tailoring recommendations, release timings, and promotions to this market can improve engagement. Broader global strategies should reflect audience habits in other key regions like Japan and South Korea.
The revenue peaks around 2017 and 2023 suggest key external and internal factors worth revisiting. Regular, year-round content releases remain critical for keeping audiences engaged.
Lastly, while Tyler Perry’s prolific output is remarkable, diversifying the director pool could help introduce new voices and storytelling approaches to broaden appeal and attract new audiences.
